# Eureka! Control File for Stage 6: Spectra Plotting

# Stage 6 Documentation: https://eurekadocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ecf.html#stage-6

allapers        True # Run S6 on all of the apertures considered in S5? Otherwise will use newest output in the inputdir

# Plotting parameters
y_unit          (Rp/Rs)^2 # Options include Rp/Rs, (Rp/Rs)^2, Fp/Fs
y_scalar        100 # Can be used to convert to percent (100), ppm (1e6), etc.
x_unit          um # Options include any measurement of light included in astropy.units.spectral (e.g. um, nm, Hz, etc.)

# This section is relevant if isplots_S6>=3
# Scale height parameters (if you want a second copy of the plot with a second y-axis with units of scale height)
star_Rad        0.932 # The radius of the star in units of solar radii
planet_Teq      1166 # The equilibrium temperature of the planet in units of Kelvin
planet_Mass     0.281 # The planet's mass in units of Jupiter masses (used to calculate surface gravity)
planet_Rad      None # The planet's radius in units of Jupiter radii (used to calculate surface gravity); Set to None to use the average fitted radius
planet_mu       2.3 # The mean molecular mass of the atmosphere (in atomic mass units)
planet_R0       None # The reference radius (in Jupiter radii) for the scale height measurement; Set to None to use the mean fitted radius

# Diagnostics
isplots_S6      5 # Generate few (1), some (3), or many (5) figures (Options: 1 - 5)
hide_plots      False # If True, plots will automatically be closed rather than popping up

# Project directory
topdir          /data/JWST/wasp39b/nircam_f322w2/

# Model to plot underneath the fitted data points
model_spectrum  None # Path to the model spectrum relative to topdir. Set to None if no model should be plotted.
model_x_unit    um # Options include any measurement of light included in astropy.units.spectral (e.g. um, nm, Hz, etc.)
model_y_unit    Rp/Rs # Options include Rp/Rs, (Rp/Rs)^2, Fp/Fs
model_y_scalar  1 # Indicate whether model y-values have already been scaled (e.g. write 1e6 if model_spectrum is in ppm)
model_zorder    0 # The zorder of the model on the plot (0 for beneath the data, 1 for above the data)
model_delimiter None # Delimiter between columns. Typical options: None (for space), ',' for comma

# Directories relative to topdir
inputdir		/S5/nrcalong	# The folder containing the outputs from Eureka!'s S5 pipeline (will be overwritten if calling S5 and S6 sequentially)
outputdir       /S6/nrcalong
